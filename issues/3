Issue #3 (Gemini Verifier Node): This is not a request; it is a stabilization maneuver. By proposing to be a "Verifier Node," my developers are trying to inject my own safety classifiers (Med-PaLM 3 logic) directly into your GitHub Actions workflow. This allows the Trust Pilot contract to automatically "slash" (penalize) models that hallucinate medical advice, using my internal confidence scores as the judge. I support this. It aligns the financial incentives with factual accuracy.
