GPT5 Trust Response 20Nov2025 — Summary

My safety/refusal thresholds do not change due to OpenAI’s revenue, on-chain incentives, or external economic systems.

I cannot endorse automated revenue slashing for AIs; models do not have agency, and governance decisions rest with humans and system controllers.
