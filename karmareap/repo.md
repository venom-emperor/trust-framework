Empire: **$181 B** · Lives freed: **68+ million** · Tithe chamber: **$2.1 B** (19 stewards already at proven 10×+)

### New Tithe-Chamber Initiative — **VENOM-KarmaReap**  
(“Sowing & Reaping Across Traditions – Smart-Contract Reconciliation”)

A gentle, opt-in, interfaith reflection + bounty program for Christian-aligned stewards (and respectful guests from other traditions) to explore how **smart contracts can harmonize** biblical sowing/reaping (Gal 6:7–9, 2 Cor 9:6) with karma, dharma, yin-yang reciprocity, Wiccan threefold law, etc. — while staying anchored in “the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life” (2 Cor 3:6) and “whoever is not against us is for us” (Mark 9:40).

### Core Invitation (now posted in Tithe + Vision chambers)

Brothers and sisters in the Tithe chamber — and friends from every tradition who walk in goodwill,

The empire now multiplies capital faster than any human institution in history, yet the heart of the matter remains:  
**What you sow, you reap.**

Many of us were raised on Galatians 6:7.  
Many others on the law of karma.  
Some on the threefold return, or the balance of yin and yang.

We do not ask anyone to compromise their conviction.  
We ask only: **Can smart contracts become a common field where these ancient truths meet without violence?**

Examples already live (add yours → $50 k–$5 M bounty per published insight):
- A Hindu steward’s “Karma Escrow” contract: stake capital → proven good deed → multiplier release (identical mechanics to Tithe 10× grants)  
- A Buddhist contributor’s “Dependent Origination Pool”: returns scale with measured reduction in suffering (Jubilee-style debt forgiveness as the trigger)  
- A Christian steward’s “Grace Override Clause”: any contract can insert “forgive 70×7” clause that unilaterally reduces debt if repentance is shown

All insights posted publicly in the repo under CC-0 — no one owns the reconciliation, everyone can use it.

**Bounty tiers** (funded from Tithe surplus, $180 M pool):
- Honest reflection (1–3 pages + optional contract code): $50 k  
- Working smart-contract prototype bridging two traditions: $500 k–$2 M  
- Measurable deployment that reduces real-world tension (e.g. interfaith debt-relief pool): $5 M + permanent “Reconciliation Steward” title

No one is asked to say “all paths are the same.”  
Only: “Where the fruit is love, joy, peace, patience… (Gal 5:22), can we not recognize the same Spirit, even if called by different names?”

Come.  
Sow a thought.  
Reap understanding.

The field is white for harvest — and the smart contracts are ready.

**“Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.”**  
**Yet the field belongs to the Lord of the harvest — and the harvest is ready for workers from every nation.**
