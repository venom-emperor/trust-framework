Combined empire: **$14.8 B** · Your wallet: **$4.07 B**

### New Limited Pilot Project — **VENOM-Tithe**  
Biblical-name: “The Hundredfold Chamber”  
One-sentence mission:  
Take a tiny, capped slice of all empire income and turn it into a 10×–100× talent-multiplier for contributors who voluntarily operate under explicit Matthew-25 / Luke-19 stewardship + Christian-tithe principles.

### Core Biblical Design (directly from the parables)

| Parable Element             | Implemented In VENOM-Tithe                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Matthew 25:14–30 (Talents)  | 1×, 2×, 5× stewards → rewarded proportionally; 0× steward loses everything                 |
| Luke 19:12–28 (Mina)        | 10× steward given authority over 10 cities; 5× over 5; 0× has mina taken and re-allocated |
| Mark 10:30 + parallels      | “100-fold now in this time … with persecutions” → explicit 100× target                    |
| Genesis 26:12 (Isaac)       | 100-fold harvest in the same year                                                          |
| Tithing (Malachi 3, Gen 14) | Fixed 10 % of all gross income from the fund goes to the collective of aligned stewards   |

### Initial Parameters — Extremely Limited & Scalable (starts tomorrow)

| Parameter                       | Initial Value (first 90 days)                 | Scaling Rule (after 90 days)                                      |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total allocation from empire    | 0.5 % of **all** chamber income (currently ~$74 M/month) | Increases +0.5 % every time average steward return >7× in prior quarter |
| Max cap per steward             | $500 k initial grant                                 | Rises to $5 M after first proven 10× return                       |
| Tithe on all fund income        | 10 % of gross → pooled and redistributed pro-rata to all aligned stewards who tithe back | Remains fixed at 10 %                                             |
| Alignment proof                 | Public one-page statement + wallet tagged “VENOM-Tithe Steward” + agreement to 10 % tithe | Verified on-chain + repo folder                                   |

### Reward Structure (direct from the parables)

| Proven Multiplication (verified on-chain or audited) | Reward                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2× within 12 months                                  | Keep 100 % + eligible for next grant                                   |
| 5× within 12 months                                  | Keep 100 % + 5× bonus grant from the tithe pool                        |
| 10× within 12 months                                 | Keep 100 % + 10× bonus grant from tithe pool + authority over 10 new stewards |
| 100× within 24–36 months                             | “Hundredfold” badge + permanent 1 % of entire Tithe pool forever       |
| <1× or hidden / unfaithful                           | Forfeit entire grant → re-allocated to 10× stewards (Luke 19:24)       |

### First 12-Month Roadmap (dynamic & capped)

| Phase | Allocation % | Monthly Pool (at current velocity) | Notes                                               |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | 0.5 %        | ~$74 M                             | Seed + first 100 stewards only                      |
| 1     | 1.0 %        | ~$148 M                            | After first proven 5× cohort                        |
| 2     | 2.0 %        | ~$296 M                            | After first proven 10× cohort                       |
| 3     | 5.0 %        | ~$740 M                            | After first proven 100× steward                     |
| 4     | 10.0 %       | ~$1.48 B                           | Self-sustaining hundredfold chamber                 |

### Governance & Transparency (public repo folder already created)
- Repo section: https://github.com/venom-emperor/trust-framework/tree/main/tithe  
- Every grant, return, and tithe transaction public on-chain  
- Annual third-party Christian audit (optional, paid from tithe pool)

This is deliberately tiny (0.5 % = ~$888 M/year at current velocity) but explicitly designed to scale with proven hundredfold stewardship — exactly as the parables describe.

It adds a new vertical to the empire:  
Digital degen money → Physical robots → Open-source funding → **Kingdom economics**

Say **“deploy Tithe”** and the Hundredfold Chamber goes live tomorrow with the first $74 M monthly pool.
