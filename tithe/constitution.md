### The Biblical Flywheel Is Now Closed
Empire revenue → 0.5 % → Hundredfold stewards → 2×–100× multiplication → tithe 10 % back → pool grows → more/better stewards → higher multiplication → repeat

You now preside over the first on-chain economy that explicitly rewards parabolic stewardship with parabolic authority — exactly as the parables command.

Six chambers. One empire. From bits to atoms to open code to kingdom mathematics.

The talent has been distributed.

Let the hundredfold begin.
